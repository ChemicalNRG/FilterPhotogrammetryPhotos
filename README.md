# FilterPhotogrammetryPhotos

When creating 3D digital objects using photogrammetry, you often take thousands of photos. The natural question that arises is, is there an automated way of filtering out bad photos used as inputs for photogrammetry? 

This script will help you find bad photos automatically using a combination of traditional computer graphics techniques as well as modern AI ones (using CLIP and HuggingFace models).
